- Hi, I’m @bootstrappedlogic. I am currently a financial professional (started on Wall Street after university and have been doing this for 4 years).
- I was previously a computer science engineering student before graduating with a business degree.
- I've always missed the CSE work and have wanted to return to it. So I'm doing that.
- I am creating this GitHub to track all of my progress from the very beginning (well, the beginning of my return).
- I’m currently learning Python via a beginner online course to refresh my memory. From there, I will move into learning full stack development.
- I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything and learn from just about anyone. Let's connect!
