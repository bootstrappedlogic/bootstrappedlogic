### hello world!
---
My name is Boots. I'll just get to the point - I am a working professional with a passion for technology. I plan to use this github to track my progress as I embark on a journey of learning and self-discovery.

I formerly attended the University of Michigan, where I spent two years as an engineering student before transferring into the business school to get my BBA. I worked in the asset management arm of a bulge bracket investment bank for a couple of years post-grad, then joined the IR departement for the world's largest public cannabis company, before most recently landing in a partner success role at an ed tech startup.

Though my path has been nothing short of unique, my passionate curiosity for technology has remained constant throughout my professional career. That said, I've decided to finally take the first tangible step toward methodically fostering that curiosity via self-learning the areas of computer science that interest me most. 

I have no set-in-stone agenda quite yet, and honestly that's the most exciting part. I'm still in what I call the "brain hurricane" phase of this whole process so I have a lot of thoughts in my head I'm hoping I can get out somehow. Right now, though, I have some general interest areas that I am looking to explore in the context of computer science and technology, and for now these are the areas I plan to explore futher via projects and online resources:
- **Python (namely automation and data applications)**: Python was the first language I learned, and its ease-of-use often re-ignites my interest in programming. I've found that the most directly applicable uses for Python for me are around automation and data, and I actually use python in my job to automate tasks for both myself and teammates.
- **LeetCode**: If people smarter than me are using it to increase their skills, who am I to argue?
- **Low-level/embedded programming**: I love the idea of taking an inanimate piece of metal and giving it life. I'm also incredibly interested in some of the more embedded applications for computers, namely aerospace technology/avionics, robotics, and IoT. I recently purchased an STM32F4 discovery board and am looking forward to exploring some projects with that. The goal is to understand how embedded systems work at a fundamental level.
- **Game development**: who doesn't love games? Built my first gaming PC in 2017 and haven't looked back. In terms of development choices, I am looking at PyGame and Godot (GDscript) as two options.

Who knows where this will go. If nothing else, hopefully this will motivate me to keep learning. I won't be taking this journey alone - I'll be leaning heavily on the community to help me learn and grow, and look forward to eventually being able to contribute myself.
