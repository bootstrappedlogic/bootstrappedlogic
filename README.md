- Hi, I’m @bootstrappedlogic. I am currently a financial professional (started on Wall Street after university and have been doing this for four years).
- I was previously a computer science engineering student before graduating with a business degree.
- I've always missed the CSE work and have wanted to return to it. So I'm doing that.
- I have no idea where this will lead me, but I figured I would document my results from day one.
- I am creating this GitHub to track all of my progress from the very beginning (well, the beginning of my return).
- I’m currently taking a beginner Python course to refresh my memory. From there, I will move into learning full stack development.
- I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything and learn from just about anyone. Let's connect!
- Creation date: September 19, 2023.
